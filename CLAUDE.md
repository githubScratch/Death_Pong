# Death Pong ("Wizard Balls") - working notes for Claude

Godot 4.4 local-multiplayer Pong/brawler hybrid. These are conventions this
project has settled on, mainly so a future session (or the same one, later)
doesn't relitigate them.

## Don't revert hand-tuned values

Numeric fields on ability `.tres` resources (strike costs, durations, scale
steps, hold buffers, etc.) get hand-tuned directly in the Godot inspector
for balance, outside of any conversation with Claude. When editing a
`.tres` (or the script whose defaults back it), always re-read the CURRENT
live file first and preserve whatever values are already there - never
reset a field to an earlier value from memory or to a script default,
unless the user explicitly asks for that value to change. Only add/remove/
restructure fields as needed for the actual request; leave every value you
aren't specifically asked to touch exactly as found.

## Ability composition pattern

`WizardAbility` (`PLAYERS/wizard_ability.gd`) is the bare base every class's
ability resource uses - just `display_name` and `shield_scene`. Fields
specific to one *kind* of ability live on a subclass, never on the shared
base, so classes that don't use a mechanic don't carry its fields in the
inspector:

- `StrikeScaledAbility` (`PLAYERS/strike_scaled_ability.gd`) - shared shape
  for any ability that scales with banked strikes: `strikes_per_tier`,
  `max_tiers`, `max_strikes`. Likely relevant to more than one class
  eventually (Blink's clone duration was designed to scale with strikes
  past 5, for instance) - extend this, don't re-declare these fields per
  ability.
- `GrowthAbility` (`PLAYERS/growth_ability.gd`) extends `StrikeScaledAbility`
  - Nature's hold-to-grow barrier specifically (`tier_scale_step`,
    `growth_duration_per_tier`, `shrink_duration`, `hold_confirm_time`,
    `tier_stutter_time`, `post_channel_hold_time`, plus a computed
    `growth_tier_scales()`).

`wizard.gd` checks ability type with `is`/`as` (e.g. `ability is
GrowthAbility`), never a boolean flag on the shared base - that's the
mechanism that keeps this opt-in per-class instead of bloating every ability
resource. When a new ability needs its own scaling mechanic, follow this
same pattern: a focused subclass (of `StrikeScaledAbility` if it scales with
strikes, of `WizardAbility` directly if not) rather than adding fields to a
shared base.

## Godot .tres corruption risk

Adding a new `@export` field to a script and then having Godot's editor
resave a `.tres` that uses it (e.g. from its automatic UID-migration pass)
can silently reset that field back to the script's default if the resave
happens before the editor's compiled view of the script catches up. This
bit us once already (`grows_on_hold` silently reset to `false`). If a
just-added field looks reset after the user reopens the project, that's the
likely cause - re-stage and read the live file directly to confirm, then
fix the value on the live (now UID-bearing) file rather than reverting the
UID migration itself.

## Known debug scaffolding still in place

`wizard.gd` has several `# TEMP DEBUG` `print()` calls (strike banking,
tier pay/lock events, up-press diagnostics) left in deliberately while the
strike/growth system is still being verified. Deferred cleanup, not
forgotten - ask before removing them, since they've been the main tool for
diagnosing several real bugs this project.
